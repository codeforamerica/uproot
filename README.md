# Uproot

A robot that maps out phone trees using Twilio calling and transcriptions

Initial project idea: https://github.com/codeforamerica/project-ideas/issues/22 (HT @lippytak)

## Status

Very early development / feasibility assessment

## Usage

Currently the repo contains exploratory work to understand the feasibility and think through technical approaches.

Specifically, right now there is a script (`make_call.rb`) for initiating calls, and a small Ruby web app (`app.rb`) providing the logic for handling the call, recording, and transcription.

The app currently calls the San Francisco Human Services Agency (SF HSA)'s phone tree.

This is all exploratory at this point, and so poorly documented for now.
